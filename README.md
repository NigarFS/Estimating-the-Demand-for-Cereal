# Estimating-the-Demand-for-Cereal

This project delves into the competitive landscape of the ready-to-eat (RTE) breakfast cereal market, focusing on product differentiation, pricing strategies, and consumer preferences. By analyzing a wide range of cereal products across different brands and categories, we aim to understand the key factors driving consumer choices and market dynamics.

Data Description
The dataset includes 50 cereal products spread over six brands, categorized into adult, kid, and family-oriented segments. Key variables examined include fat, sugar, calories, and average shelf price.

Key Findings
Price Sensitivity: There's a strong relationship between average shelf price and consumer behavior, with higher prices leading to lower sales.
Sugar Content: Higher sugar content is linked to reduced cereal consumption, indicating health-conscious consumer preferences.
Brand Influence: The analysis reveals the significant impact of brand-related factors on consumer choices, highlighting the importance of brand reputation and perceived quality.
Methodology
To address the endogeneity problem in price and demand analysis, we employed instrumental variables such as average advertising expenditure by brand and average transaction price. This approach helps isolate exogenous variations and provides a more accurate assessment of consumer behavior.

Conclusion
Our comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of considering both product attributes and brand dynamics in understanding consumer preferences. The insights gained can inform strategic decisions in marketing, product development, and competitive positioning within the RTE breakfast cereal market.
